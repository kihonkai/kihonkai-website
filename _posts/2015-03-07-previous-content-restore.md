I've finally got the previous content restored and online.  For now I'll keep this short, soon I'm going to write up a bit more about my experience of migrating from Drupal to Jekyll.

Also I've added a [Contact Form](/contact/).  There's probably not a lot of need for it but I like to think the option is there if anyone wants to post a comment.
