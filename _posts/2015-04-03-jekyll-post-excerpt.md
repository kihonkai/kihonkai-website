title: "Jekyll Feature - Post excerpts"

While looking at my website recently I decided to try and add more than the title to the list of posts.

The Post excerpts feature of Jekyll was easy enough to find in the [Writing posts](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) page of the documentation.  

Below are the before and after screenshots of enabling this.  I think I prefer it with the excerpts, I've seen a few blogs while looking at examples of Jekyll that use only the title format.

I could only get the default style of breaking on the first paragraph working, it seems using excerpt_separator per post isn't working or I'm doing something wrong.  When I have chance I'll look into it.
