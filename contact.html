  	I wanted a simple way some someone to submit any comments about my website or the content.  Since I've decided to use Jekyll, A static site generator, It doesn't include comments per page out of the box.  For now using Google Forms lets me offer a method of communication with very little effort.

  	At some point in the future I'll probably look at setting up comments per page.  Before I do that I want to get use to using Jekyll.
