   Third day, this will be the first with only a single new Kanji. I wanted to get through the lower numbers in a couple of days rather than using 10 separate days. I'm also aiming to review the Kanji from the previous days on each new day. Here's the new Kanji for today. I'm also enlarging the font to make it easier to see the stokes.
