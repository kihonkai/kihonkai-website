   I've moved away from the series of related Kanji now. The rest are mostly just various Kanji I have learnt on the Uni course I've been doing. Sometimes it will include opposite words like big &amp; small, but that is the generally most they will be related now.

   I'm only going to include one compound word with this Kanji. The entry in my Kanji dictionary for 本 is far longer than the previous Kanji.
