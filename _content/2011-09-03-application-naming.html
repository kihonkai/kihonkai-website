   I wrote about my idea for a project, I want to get started with this so I will need a name to use on BitBucket and for local files storage. So I need to pick a name. The best I can think of so far is
   <strong>
    InfoLog
   </strong>
   , but I don't really like it and its already got some use out there. I could go with a random code name but then that would end up being used as the namespace in the C# projects. there's quite a few examples of code names on this page

   I think I may stick to InfoLog for now so I can get started working on it.
