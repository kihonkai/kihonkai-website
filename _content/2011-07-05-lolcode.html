   ) again. I had brought it a while ago but stopped reading it for a while. I was just reviewing parts I had read already before I start moving onto the parts I have not read yet (starting at chapter 10).

   I was just looking about pseudo code and if there was any comments about saving it in a version control system, I've not found any yet. But I did find an interesting post on
   <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/">
    http://programmers.stackexchange.com
   </a>
   . This is the question I found:
   <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/681/29841">

   </a>
  </p>

   and it's this question I found entertaining:
   <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/681/what-language-is-most-like-pseudocode/1838#1838">

  <p>
   here's some LOLCODE:

  <p>

   <br/>
   VISIBLE "HAI WORLD!"
   <br/>
   KTHXBYE
  </p>
  <p>
