   I've been offline for a while again but I will be back on shortly.  My new coding project at home will produce a working game though it won't have a GUI in the first version.
   <br/>
   I found a couple of interesting websites:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/11/21/whats-all-this-nonsense-about-katas">
     What's all this nonsense about Katas?
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/06/30/whats-your-favorite-kata">
     What's your favorite Kata?
    </a>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   This led me to finding the idea of Coding Kata which is basically a coined term for practicing programming.  I like the idea and decided that I'm going to try one.  I'm going to use
   <a href="http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/Katas.MonopolyTheGame(r)">
    Monopoly
   </a>
   for my first attempt.  The link provides some stages for developing the Monopoly game.
   <br/>
   I think I will use this site to record my progress or I might find something else.  For the notes on this site I decided to setup
   <a href="http://ckeditor.com/">
    CKeditor
   </a>
   so I can use formatted posts to make the site a bit easier to read and more interesting.  The code will most likely get uploaded to
   <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">
    https://bitbucket.org/
   </a>
   as I've used this in the past for coding and I may choose to use that for documenting the work as it has a wiki.
