   I came across this
   <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/39791/moving-from-winforms-to-wpf">
    Stackoverflow post
   </a>
   . It's basically what I am trying to do now, I already know Windows Forms and I'm starting to learn WPF.

   This post had a link to
   <a href="http://wpftutorial.net/">
    wpftutorial.net
   </a>
   , I found some of the content on that site to be useful. But I just tried the link again now and it failed, maybe just a bit of downtime. For today I will continue using the MSDN documentation.
