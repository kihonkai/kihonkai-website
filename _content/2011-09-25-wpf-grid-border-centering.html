   I was attempting to create a grid with borders, using the same test app as my
   <a href="#">
    last post
   </a>
   . I thought it wasn't going to work, then I found a
   <a href="http://codebetter.com/stevehebert/2008/04/16/creating-a-horizontal-gridsplitter-for-real/">
    webpage
   </a>
   that linked to an MSDN
   <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb675313.aspx">
    article How to: Create User-Resizable Applications with GridSplitter
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   For some reason that guy didn't think the MSDN articles worked. I've not been through all of the code I gained my answer without doing so. Maybe he's right, maybe he's not.

   The solution I found was to create the separate grid row/column for the borders, the linked pages do talk about the GridSplitter, I was going to test using that rather than a border. Since the pages suggest the use of a separate row/column I figure that the GridSplitter works in the same way. I guess the way the WPF layout system works prevents the collapse behavior that web developer would be familiar with from using a HTML table (

    see here

   if interested).

   For now I think that might be enough practice with the grid control. I don't really need to be able to do this right now, but I have learnt a few bits from doing this testing.
