   The compass directions had come up in the book I've been using in lessons (
   <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Japanese-Busy-People-Kana-Version/dp/4770030096/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319363860&amp;sr=8-2">
    Japanese for Busy People - book 1 Kana edition, third edition
   </a>
   ). They also came up in some of the tests I've done. But since the break between years I have forgotten them. So I've just looked them up and written them down. To keep practising them I wrote them on bits of paper and blutacked them to the wall at home.

  <p>
   I found this page that lists them all quite easily with some extra detail:

   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Here's a simple list of them:
  </p>
  <ul style="font-size:150%;">
   <li>
    北 - きた
   </li>
   <li>
    南 - みなみ
   </li>
   <li>
    東 - ひがし
   </li>
   <li>
    西 - にし
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   I've ordered them in the common UK style, N-S-E-W. According to
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction">
    Wikipedia
   </a>
   E-W-S-N is used in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   Something interested about the Japan and it seems other countries is that they have a fifth element for the "Central" direction. This is what is used in Japan.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span style="font-size:150%;">
    中 - ちゅう
   </span>
  </p>
  <p>
   This was not covered in the book I read or mentioned by our sensei.
