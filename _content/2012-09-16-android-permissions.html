   For a long time now I've not liked the descriptions of many of the permissions for Android apps, I'm not going to get into detail as I don't have a lot of time. My most recent look at permissions came about while I'm looking at using Evernote. I noticed the app
   <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evernote.hello&amp;hl=en">
    Evernote Hello
   </a>
   which does look interesting. What I don't like is that it has these permissions listed:
  </p>
  <p>
   YOUR ACCOUNTS
   <br/>
   ACT AS AN ACCOUNT AUTHENTICATOR
   <br/>
   Allows the app to use the account authenticator capabilities of the AccountManager, including creating accounts and getting and setting their passwords.
   <br/>
   MANAGE THE ACCOUNTS LIST
   <br/>
   Allows the app to perform operations like adding and removing accounts, and deleting their password.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's the part about being able to change/get passwords like sounds really bad to me. So I decided to do a bit of digging into the API regarding the
   <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html">
    AccountManager
   </a>
   . I found that it has this line along with the authenticator permissions:
  </p>
  <p>
   This method requires the caller to hold the permission AUTHENTICATE_ACCOUNTS and to have the same UID as the added account's authenticator.
  </p>
  <p>
   which basically means that for the most part that permission should not be so bad. I exported a list of apps to see what shared UIDs were used. The Evernote Hello app doesn't even share a UID with the main Evernote app. So I don't know what they use the permission for so I've submitted the question to the support desk.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Manage accounts permission looks like it does not have the same restriction but deals with the local version of the account only. So deleting a password does not affect the account on whatever server (e.g. gmail or facebook).
  </p>
  <p>
   But I wonder if using AccountManager.updateCredentials it would be possible to get a user to type a password into a spoof screen and log it. Mainly due to this part in the API docs:
  </p>
  <p>
   "The Activity context to use for launching a new authenticator-defined sub-Activity to prompt the user to enter a password; used only to call startActivity(); if null, the prompt will not be launched directly, but the necessary Intent will be returned to the caller instead".
  </p>
  <p>
   There's a good chance I'm being incredible paranoid about this with big companies like Evernote or Facebook. But it is certainly not a permission I would allow on an app from a random developer that I've never heard of before.
