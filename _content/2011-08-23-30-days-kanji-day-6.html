   First Kanji other than numbers today. And the start of another series, but this one I am going to add one per day.

   This is also to me the first of the more complicated Kanji. To my understanding the previous Kanji all mean a single number (with the exception of being able to say 4, 7 &amp; 9 in different ways). But this kanji has more than one meaning. I have thought about adding some examples of compound words with more than one Kanji to each entry but I'm not quite sure yet how to format it or what to include. If I include too many it will end up like a dictionary entry when I have the link for that.
  </p>
  <p>
   So for now I am just going to include one on this post and I am going to edit yesterday's post to make a correction and add a compound.

   <span style="font-size:500%;">
    十日
   </span>
   -
   <span style="font-size:250%;">
    とおか
   </span>
   - the tenth day of the month; ten days.
  </p>
  <p>
   I picked this compound since it includes a Kanji I've already done though with a different meaning.
