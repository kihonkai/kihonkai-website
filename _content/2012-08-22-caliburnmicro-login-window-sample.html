   Last week I noticed a
   <a href="http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/discussions/391974">
    question
   </a>
   related to Caliburn.Micro that I was interested in. So I decided to have a go at coding a solution. While I was thinking about it someone posted an
   <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12013139/647292">
    answer
   </a>
   to the post on
   <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">
    stackoverflow.com
   </a>
   . While it wasn't a complete solution I had a go coding that and it does work.
  </p>
  <p>
   But I decided to attempt it how the original author wanted it done. Today I thought about using the IEventAggregator service and the idea of a separate "Conductor" I got from reading
   <a href="http://neverindoubtnet.blogspot.co.uk/2009/05/birth-and-death-of-m-v-vm-triads.html">
    Birth and Death of M-V-VM Triads
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   So this is how the app basically works:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    AppBootstrapper does not use the Genetic version of Bootstrapper. It overloads OnStartup
   </li>
   <li>
    OnStartup is used to create a LoginConductor class
   </li>
   <li>
    LoginConductor basically handles events from for IEventAggregator. OnStartup publishes the LoginEvent to get things started
   </li>
   <li>
    The LoginEvent an instance of LoginWindow to be created and shown. This is the part that's not true to the MVVM style but if you have a fixed requirement I don't see any harm in using it. Done right you should be able to replace the real version with a Mock version for unit testing still.
   </li>
   <li>
    When a login event is handled and is valid it uses the WindowsManager of Caliburn.Micro to open the ViewModel based main window
   </li>
   <li>
    The logout and exit buttons both use events change the state of the system.
   </li>
   <li>
    The logout event closes the main window and uses the Login event to open the LoginWindow again
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   To be honest I don't think this is a perfect solution for the following reasons:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    I'm currently not totally sure it releases memory efficiently with the events and repeating the logout/login process
   </li>
   <li>
    LoginConductor is probably something that could be done using IConductor or one of the existing base classes
   </li>
   <li>
    I didn't try IConductor yet since most of it is focused around Silverlight and I'm not very familiar with that to fully understand demo's of it
   </li>
   <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
    <ul>
     <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
      <p>
       Another thing I had thought about is the HelloScreens sample that comes with Caliburn.Micro, Which is Silverlight but someone recently posted about a
       <a href="http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/discussions/392246">
        WPF version of HelloScreens
       </a>
       . One issue I felt with the HelloScreens sample is that it adds a lot of extra "Framework" code to the system which doesn't currently have a lot of documentation in the code though the page
       <a href="http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Screens%2c%20Conductors%20and%20Composition&amp;referringTitle=Documentation">
        Screens, Conductors and Composition
       </a>
       in the Caliburn.Micro documentation does have quite a bit of detail. I will probably have to read through that page again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though I don't think its the best solution I've included the source code just in case it's of any use to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the main issues with this test was that it contains a Window that is not built for MVVM so it required different processing. I think what I will do next is try and work with a the Conductors built into Caliburn.Micro to see what I can manage with a full MVVM application as that is what I will be able to create in the app that I need a login screen for.
