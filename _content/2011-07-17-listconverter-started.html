   I've made a very small start to the ListConverter project I am planning. So far I have only setup the BitBucket repository and create a couple of pages on the Wiki. The first page includes the original Python version of the program I created and the second provides a simple list of the formats I have used so far.

   At this point I need to decide how I am going to plan out the software. The aim it to avoid "hacking" away until the program is complete. But since I am writing the program for my use I don't know how to design it and record the requirements. I have thought about just using the issues tracker and Wiki in BitBucket, the issues can track the main points and the Wiki can contain further details.
