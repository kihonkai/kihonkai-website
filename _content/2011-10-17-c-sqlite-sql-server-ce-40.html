   Over the weekend I worked on the InfoLog project that I have spoken about shortly in previous posts. I was attempting to use SQLite so that I could load up different files easily and avoid installing a full database. It also seemed like a good idea to do it this way so that you could keep backups of the data files and give them to other people etc.

   Once I started trying to set this up I started to find that SQLite is not currently fully compatible with the Entity Framework 4.0. After spending some time trying to get it working I decided to cut my losses and try something else. This is where the SQL Server Compact Edition 4.0 comes in. Since this has built in support for the Entity Framework it just worked straight away. So for now I can continue my work on the project, but it has a drawback. eventually I would like to have something I can use one Windows, Linux and probably Android. But using SQL Server based database will probably make it very hard to work on anything but Windows.

   Honestly, I'm not very happy with the way that my work on this is going yet. I don't have a clear idea of what I want out of it and it has such a vast overall goal that it's hard to visualise how it would all fit together. I am tempted to go back to learning C'# in more detail to see if I can regain some focus in my programming abilities. And if I am lucky I hope to find some easier applications to write on the way.
