   It’s been a while since I've been on here again, maybe this time it will stick.  I'm looking at really simplifying the development I try to get back into programming.
  </p>
  <p>
   To start with the new work I’m going to use Git on GitHub.com for version control.  I’m also going to use a different license to what I talked about before (
   <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/content/software-license-sample-code">
    Software license for sample code
   </a>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   I think I prefer the idea of the
   <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/">
    BSD (3-Clause) License
   </a>
   .  It is still permissive but at least avoids the misuse of my name, permitting people follow the license.
  </p>
  <p>
   Anyway, we will see how this new attempt goes.  My GitHub account can be found here:
