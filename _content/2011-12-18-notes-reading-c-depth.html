   I really need to start doing the same blogging technique Adam is using. For now heres some notes on the current bit I'm reading 2011-12-18 around 10:00 (at NTU Boots Library): Chapter 2: - unboxing always happens when you call GetType() as this cannot be overridden. I'm not really sure exactly why it would do on this one. It also mentions ToString, Equals and GetHashCode. They can be overridden so I assume the default behaviour is to conver the value and return it. - the last section that talks about nullable types shows a shorthand form I don't recall. -- Its "??" which is basically if the left value is null use the right value -- I'm guessing this was to follow on from the "?" if shorthand --- this is called "conditional operator" on MSDN and includes "?" &amp; ":". Its related to my mind though.
