   A while ago I came across this project and found it quite interesting. They have already release a version that lets you navigate through the documentation for code in their application. Just recently they have announced that beta testing with be starting soon for version 1.2. This will have the very useful feature of exporting the documentation to version formats.

   Here's the link to the main page for the application:

   I just signed up for it before I posted this. It's waiting now to see if they accept my registration.
