   I was setting up a basic question/answer page, I thought to use jQuery to let the user toggle visibility of the answer. My thought is that you can't see the answer straight away so you have a decent change of thinking about it and learning it easier.

  <p>
   It was going well, until I had more than a single screen and it needed to scroll down, the link I had created for the toggle was scrolling to the top of the page. A quick google search found the issue. Basically I was using a hash in the url like this:
  </p>
  <p>
   &lt;a href="#"&gt;Show Answer&lt;/a&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
   I found that I needed to change it to this:
  </p>
  <p>
   &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Show Answer&lt;/a&gt;
  </p>

   Here's the page that I found explaining it more:

   </a>
   .

   I figured that lists solutions like this will give me something to look back on and an extra place for others to find the answer as well.
