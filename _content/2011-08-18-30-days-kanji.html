   As I mentioned in my
   <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/content/blog-post-day">
    last post
   </a>
   I found the idea of doing a post a day on a topic an interesting idea. Currently I don't know of a topic in development that I could do this for, maybe I will one day but not right now.
  </p>
  <p>
   But I have a topic I can use which is Japanese and more specifically Kanji. So I am going to do 30 days of Kanji. This will mainly be a way for me to try out the idea and aid my studying before I start the next stage at a Uni I've been studying it at. I've titled it slightly differently by using the "30 Days of" title since I am not going to start it with only one Kanji a day. I'm also not doing it on a certain month since that would mean waiting a couple of weeks to get started.
  </p>
  <p>
   So later tonight once I have done some practice reading and writing the kanji I will post the set for today :).
