   I noticed the link for this site on the msn homepage
   <a href="http://him.uk.msn.com/in-the-know/10-ways-to-boost-brain-power">

   </a>
   . It was the section about language that caught my interest and took me to the earworm website (
   <a href="http://www.earwormslearning.com/discover/index.php">
    http://www.earwormslearning.com/discover/index.php
   </a>
   ). I might get the Japanese version of it.

  <p>
   Their FAQ section then linked to the BBC language website that has a section on Japanese as well (
   <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/japanese/facts.shtml">
    http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/japanese/facts.shtml
   </a>
   ). The facts page has a Japanese version with an mp3 download that could be a useful bit of material for some practice :).

   This is the type of content that I would eventually like to store in the program I have talked about previously. that way it would be easy to find things like this again in the future.
