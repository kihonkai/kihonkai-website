  <p>
   I'm starting to post some sample code on
   <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">
    http://stackoverflow.com/
   </a>
   . While it would be nice to just not have to worry about this just focus on the development I think it's worth a bit of time.
  </p>
  <p>
   I've decided that any actually programs I release now I will use the MIT License (
   <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">
    http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
   </a>
   ). But for basic samples I post on the internet I don't think its nice to require the addition of a copyright notice for something someone may only use a small part of the code from the sample. Maybe I'm over thinking it but I think its better to have something there. Unfortunately part of it is just to add the disclaimer to protect myself against peoples use of the software, there are people that would blame you if something went terribly wrong even if you made no claim that it was fully tested and fit for use etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   So for any larger samples I post I'm going to use the following slightly modified version of the MIT License. The only change I have made is to remove the condition to include this notice with the code.
