   So I've started drawing the design and thought I would put up a image of the basic layouts I'm thinking about.

   The program will convert one format of text to another, based on lists of values. Full details can be found here:

   I'm not sure how to lay out the form. the attached image includes three designs I had thought about. the first one I had (top left) fit into my use of the app well but I think it will waste a lot of space. Normally I convert a list of values split by new lines into something else. So I thought about a vertical textbox and a horizontal one, maybe even have the horizontal one below the vertical one. but that would make the form larger and waste a lot of space.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other option is to split the two text boxes half and half on the form. I then get to choose if I should do it horizontally or vertically. I'm currently swaying towards horizontal since half of the text used will commonly fit like that.
  </p>
  <p>
   While it didn't take that long for me to think through these idea's in my head it takes quite a bit of text to explain them even for such a small point. But I am doing this as a learning exercise so I'm trying to record what I think about while doing it. In this case it's the layout of the form, but if I make both text boxes use horizontal and vertical scroll bars for excess content it makes it far easier to view a large vertical list of values even in the horizontally layout. At least that is what I have in mind so far.
