   P.S. I'm going to be honest with this one, I did forgot to post it yesterday. I could have fixed the Authored On date so that it looked like I had not missed it, but I figured I might as well record it anyway. It's not like it does any harm to miss a day on this. I had thought this might happen since I've not put any reminders to post each day. I had decided to take a trip to IKEA yesterday. but I chose to go by bus and since I didn't have any plans I just set off and looked at time as I got to the bus station. That didn't work that well, I ended up missing one bus by a few minutes and it took about 2-3 times longer to get there compared to when I drove down recently. By the time I had looked at what I needed to I stopped by my parents house since I was thinking of borrowing their car since its larger. Then I again missed a bus and had to wait almost an hour. I had set off at 15:00 and got home just about 22:00. So quite a long day of buses and walking between stops and places. I had done some written practice of the Kanji for yesterday in the morning though, so I had thought about it on the right day.
