   Yet another tough issue with Linux. I watched dcron for cronie as it seems that is a recommended step. But then I couldn't run some scripts. I had to create links in the /etc/cron.d/hourly folder and it didnt work. I eventually found that it was using the run-parts command and that had a test mode. That further lead me to find that I could not use filenames with extensions and I had to make sure the files had execute permission.

   The python files were even worse, they needed the shebag adding and the windows line end removing. I had to use a command like this:
  </p>
  <p>
   tr -d '\r' file.py
  </p>
  <p>
   But I think it's working now. I just need to finish my monitoring scripts for the system status. Then I will be happier to leave the server on all the time.
